In her dreams of resistance she is deeply encouraged by the smallest signs of other women's having shared her desire to resist. The ending is left open to interpretation or speculation: Offred is speeding away as she has longed to, but is the van that carries her headed for freedom or not? A coda set in the year 2195, during which the events of the novel are presented as having been uncovered by historical research, shows the society of the novel as having now become a topic for academic study: yet even scholarly condescension to the period studied cannot conceal the fact that many changes initiated by Gilead have not been reversed.</P></SHORTPROSE></TEXTUALFEATURES><RECEPTION><SHORTPROSE><P><RRECOGNITIONS><NAME STANDARD="Atwood, Margaret" REF="https://commons.cwrc.ca/orlando:b01b26bc-1d1f-47bf-84c9-c529c68de6f0">MA</NAME> won her second <RRECOGNITIONNAME>Governor-General's Medal</RRECOGNITIONNAME> for this novel.<SCHOLARNOTE><P>Bibliographer <NAME STANDARD="Meier, John" REF="https://commons.cwrc.ca/orlando:3eb1c0e9-2435-45c7-931b-d6070cde3985">John Meier</NAME>'s collection of Governor-General's-winning novels includes a copy of <TITLE TITLETYPE="MONOGRAPHIC">The Handmaid's Tale</TITLE> inscribed from Atwood (<SOCALLED>Peggy A.</SOCALLED>) to <NAME STANDARD="MacEwen, Gwendolyn" REF="https://commons.cwrc.ca/orlando:ffb5e194-c275-4441-89a1-e5c19b870855">Gwendolyn MacEwen</NAME>, whose poetry has twice won the award.<BIBCITS><BIBCIT PLACEHOLDER="Lederman R2" DBREF="52846" REF="https://commons.cwrc.ca/orlando:3405ce8a-e852-471d-a114-463fdcbe7583">R2</BIBCIT></BIBCITS></P></SCHOLARNOTE></RRECOGNITIONS> <RRESPONSES RESPONSETYPE="INITIAL" FORMALITY="FORMAL">A review in <TITLE TITLETYPE="JOURNAL">Library Journal</TITLE> called this book <QUOTE DIRECT="Y">a startling departure</QUOTE> from Atwood's previous work, and linked the ideology of Gilead to <QUOTE DIRECT="Y">far-right <NAME STANDARD="Schafly, Phyllis" REF="https://commons.cwrc.ca/orlando:464ad803-6a44-4151-a6f9-e7728452b7db">Schafly</NAME>/<NAME STANDARD="Falwell, Jerry" REF="https://commons.cwrc.ca/orlando:16020b93-007f-4728-9834-d332cdb45f36">Falwell</NAME>-type ideals.</QUOTE><BIBCITS/><NAME STANDARD="McCarthy, Mary" REF="https://commons.cwrc.ca/orlando:9b19fb17-552a-44be-9366-b3e5f736cdb5">Mary McCarthy</NAME> in the <TITLE TITLETYPE="JOURNAL">New York Times</TITLE> was <QUOTE DIRECT="Y">largely negative</QUOTE>, finding the story both unlikely and unimaginative.<BIBCITS><BIBCIT PLACEHOLDER="Atwood, Ustopia 26" DBREF="70827" REF="https://commons.cwrc.ca/orlando:23f20627-a274-4888-9a84-67b533ed5490">26</BIBCIT></BIBCITS></RRESPONSES> <PCIRCULATION>But the novel made Atwood an international and interdisciplinary figure—known far beyond Canada and beyond literary circles—almost overnight.

Readers already steeped in this fictional world will be disappointed if they wish for a conclusion predicting its future, but not if they wish to learn more of its past, which here comes to an epic climax. The <TCHARACTERTYPEROLE>human survivors</TCHARACTERTYPEROLE> depicted in <TITLE TITLETYPE="MONOGRAPHIC">The Year of the Flood</TITLE> survive this violent climax, all except Jimmy (or <TCHARACTERNAME REG="Snowman">Snowman-the-Jimmy</TCHARACTERNAME>, as the Crakers now call him) and Adam (who once was <TCHARACTERNAME REG="Adam One">Adam One</TCHARACTERNAME>). Human genes are being passed on, some though not all of them mixed with Craker genes: there are babies. Human beings and Crakers (which is, of course, a human name and not what they call themselves) co-operate movingly in this story (and in crisis the Pigoons, too, surprisingly become allies), but it is clear that their continued co-existence will not be easy. Crakers have none of the heroic human individuation shared by the central characters. They eat only leaves (which means they eat all the time, as they also sing, eerily, much of the time); they find meat (<SOCALLED>a smelly bone</SOCALLED>) intolerably disgusting. They mate only in season and then a female mates with four males (the fourfathers); genetic inheritance is unknown. They believe powerfully in goodness and not at all in evil; they see Crake and Oryx as twin originating deities, powerful and beneficent. All this means that the history covered in these novels is not intelligible to them, except in simplified and santized form.</P><P><TSETTINGDATE SETTINGDATETYPE="FUTURE">The human story in this book dwells, as before, both in the present and past.</TSETTINGDATE> In the spotlight are Toby and her lover Zeb, who have lived mostly apart, and need to fill each other in about their pasts. Zeb grew up as the <TCHARACTERTYPEROLE>rejected, scapegoat son</TCHARACTERTYPEROLE> of the man heading the Church of PetrOleum (whose church is new but whose <TCHARACTERTYPEROLE>sanctimonious, sadistic hypocrisy</TCHARACTERTYPEROLE> has been seen in fictional clerics before him) and as the brother of Adam, the future <TCHARACTERNAME>Adam One</TCHARACTERNAME>. Here <TTHEMETOPIC>genetic inheritance</TTHEMETOPIC> has immense importance but is for a long time unknowable. Zeb has worked undercover in a sequence of false identities, <TTECHNIQUES TECHNIQUETYPE="DICTION">and deals with emotional pain by coarseness of language. Toby takes over from Jimmy the task of telling stories to the Crakers which translate the action into terms they can understand: simplified, sanitized, nursery-storied.</TTECHNIQUES> When a little-boy Craker named <TCHARACTERNAME>Blackbeard</TCHARACTERNAME> (according to the jokey inappropriateness once favoured by Crake) attaches himself to her she teaches him the mysteries of <TTHEMETOPIC>writing</TTHEMETOPIC>, a magic means of making paper talk. The apocalyptic showdown between the dehumanized Painballers and the tiny human fighting force (with Blackbeard and three pigoons) takes place at the former Paradice Project where Crake developed the first Crakers. For little Blackbeard this is a sacred place; he is devastated, perhaps marked forever, to discover the decayed corpses of the immortal Oryx and Crake, now <SOCALLED>a smelly bone</SOCALLED>. In the end Blackbeard inherits Toby's story-telling role. The Crakers have entered history and culture: perhaps most tellingly of all, when Toby, like Zeb before her, leaves the colony never to return, Blackbeard records the several competing explanations of where she has gone: the pigoons' version that she died alone and was eaten by vultures, as well as the Crakers' better, because happier, version: that she took spirit form and was reunited with Zeb.</P></SHORTPROSE></TEXTUALFEATURES><RECEPTION><SHORTPROSE><P><NAME STANDARD="Greer, Andrew Sean" REF="https://commons.cwrc.ca/orlando:8e2c2d30-afc0-45dd-a346-2a60665a96ce">Andrew Sean Greer</NAME>'s review called the Children of Crake sexy, innocent, and exhausting.
